  We are Ἀγοραία -- A proof of concept for onboarding the world into Web3.

Initially, we are building a Peer-to-Peer package delivery protocol/marketplace to enable entrepreneurship globally. By establishing and creating a distributed network of courier drivers globally, Ἀγοραία can grow a decentralized network of courier drivers to fulfill and delivery any sized package. Participants join the marketplace and post a package listing, there they determine the compensation rate for the independent courier to fulfill the delivery service.

Ἀγοραία goes much further than just a peer-to-peer package delivery protocol, as the marketplace continues to grow and prove viable in regions, developers can build and replicate similar peer-to-peer services. By creating a unity of Web3 P2P services, any individual can become an entrepreneur without needing to supply previous experience about their abilities to perform services. Entire companies, and enterprises and be grown from the ground up in Web3. Ἀγοραία is much greater than any solo project/company in Web3, it is a social movement to onboard the worlds entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs, charities, governments, organizations into blockchains.

Developers can scale and expand the Scroll based smart contract and Smart Tokens into various protocols -- by providing developers with a playground of components, ANY developer/entrepreneur can create their own peer-to-peer market.

For example: P2P markets range from: Package Delivery, Ride-sharing Services, Professional photography Services, Commerce sites delivered directly on Web3 delivery networks, Concrete construction services, Logistic services, long distance deliveries.

This is the definition of social impact. We will change the world, because of Web3. This technology will impact all of us developers FAR beyond what we will ever truly be able to comprehend. Join Ἀγοραία. Join the social movement.
